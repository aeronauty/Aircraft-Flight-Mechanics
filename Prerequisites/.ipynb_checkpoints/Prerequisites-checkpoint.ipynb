    "-   **Ailerons** - these are outboard on each wing, and operate in *differential mode*, meaning if one goes up, the other goes down. These are effected via a sideways stick/yoke movement. This increases lift on one wing, and decreases it on the other, effecting a *roll rate*, $p$, which changes the roll angle, $\\phi$.\n",

The camber line is the midpoint between the upper and lower surface at all points.\n",

    "The most important parameter for lift is *angle of attack*. We define the incident velocity at $V_\\infty$, and the angle of attack is the angle it makes with the chord line of the aerofoil. This angle is given the symbol $\\alpha$ - see {numref}`AoAAlpha`.\n",

    "### Where does lift come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, an aerofoil provides a *pressure difference* by accelerating the flow over the upper surface, and retarding the flow over the lower surface. **This has nothing to do with the airflow 'catching up' at the trailing edge** - and though you'll find plenty of sources for the so-called Bernoulli fallacy, it is wholly incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your third year classes, you will have covered the *circulatory theory of lift*, and discovered that it is the tendency of the aerofoil to 'circulate' the air that provides lift. Hence a symmetric aerofoil at an angle of attack produces lift, and a cambered aerofoil produces some lift at zero angle of attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to describe where lift comes from, you can say that '*an aerofoil with a sharp trailing edge, if immersed in a viscous flowfield, will create about itself sufficient circulation such that the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly (aka the Kutta condition)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key effects of this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The flow is accelerated over the upper surface and retarded over the lower surface\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This causes a pressure rise on the lower surface and a pressure drop on the upper surface\n",
    "\n",
    "-   These pressures, when integrated, give rise to lift (and some drag, which we'll talk about later).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The lift coefficient is linearly proportional to the *angle of attack*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lift vs Alpha (and a few other things).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot the lift coefficient vs angle of attack, we get a curve that looks like {numref}`ClAlphaSymmetric`. You will notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first part of the curve is linear, and it has the slope of $C_L=2\\,\\pi/\\text{rad}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The lift curve slope is defined as $a=\\frac{\\partial C_L}{\\partial\\alpha}$, which we define just for this linear part.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The curve stops being linear as it approaches its maximum - this is the start of nonlinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The maximum lift the aerofoil can produce is $C_{Lmax}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   At angles of attack beyond $\\alpha_{stall}$, the aerofoil is fully stalled and the flow is *separated*\n",
    "\n",
    "- It *should* be $C_l$ and not $C_L$ on the y-axis, but I am too lazy to correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the symmetric aerofoil, we can determine the lift from $C_L=a\\,\\alpha$, where $a$ is the lift curve slope. When we introduce camber to the aerofoil, we shift the $C_L-\\alpha$ curve to the left. You'll note that for the symmetric aerofoil, there is zero lift produced at an angle of attack of zero.

    "\n",
    "As the fluid velocity gets faster, these disturbances travel at rates that are slower and slower compared to the fluid velocity. Whilst we won't get into the mathematics of compressible flow, we can probably see that the lift produced will be a function of how fast the fluid is traveling compared to the speed of sound. So we have just defined the *Mach number*, which is our dimensionless measure of speed compared to $a$: \n",

    "-   Lift is the aerodynamic force arising from a pressure differential due to the flow being accelerated over the top of a lifting surface, and retarded over the bottom.\n",

    "-   For our purposes, lift is associated with the creation of 'circulation' which is the tendency of the flow to circulate the aerofoil in a manner which causes this flow change.\n",

    "Drag the component of aerodynamic force that opposes aircraft motion. Whilst it might appear slightly more easy to intuit than lift, it can be a whole load more complicated. Semenal textbooks are written on Drag, so the following is presented as a simplification to be able to use drag to develop relationships for aircraft flight mechanics. We'll firstly describe two main sources of drag:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skin Friction Drag\n",
    "\n",
    "Skin friction drag is a direct result of viscosity. We discussed the concept of a *boundary layer* in class, and we know that the flow directly next to the surface of a solid body is *stagnant* - this is why dust doesn't get removed from your moving car!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, we can consider the fluid velocity closest to the surface as zero, and it increasing with the distance from the surface until it reaches the freestream velocity. In order for the flow to be retarded, work needs to be done to it, and this is transferred through shear forces in the fluid and frictional forces between the fluid and solid body. This force is applied to the body in the same direction is fluid motion, and is called **skin friction drag**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that for more complex geometries such as aerofoils, the local surface direction may not be the same as the streamwise direction, so the component of the force parallel to the inclement freestream must be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pressure Drag\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already established that *lift* is caused by a pressure difference on an aerofoil being resolved into the direction normal to the fluid motion. If we resolve these pressures into a direction parallel to the freestream, we arrive at **pressure drag**. We further subdivide pressure drag into:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pressure Drag 1: **Form Drag** \n",
    "\n",
    "Associated with the growth of a boundary layer. We can appreciate that the boundary layer, and a trailed wake will change the effective size of a body that a fluid must move around. Hence a large boundary layer will cause more drag.\n",
    "If we recall our ideal cylinder in 2D flow, we'll note that it has zero drag (no wake, no pressure drag, no friction):\n",
    "\n",
    "As we introduce viscosity, we also introduce the Reynold's number of the flow, and change the attachment and separation points. This gives us a *wake* of varying size, which depends on the Reynold's number:\n",

    "Note that the size of the wake is not necessarily a linear or continuous function of the Reynold's number between these two examples - but for these two examples, the **form drag** would be higher with the lower $Re$ example.\n",

    "#### Pressure Drag 2:  **Induced Drag**\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D effect associated with a trailing vortex system. A wing that produces lift will produce a tip vortex, causing the air to rotate behind the aircraft. The energy associated with imparting this rotational motion to the air is **induced drag**.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Pressure Drag 3: **Wave Drag**\n",
    "\n",
    "Associated with shocks. We don't really need to cover it in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the components of drag above, we note that both *skin friction* and *form drag* are due to viscosity, and hence cannot be modelled in the potential/'ideal' aerodynamic model we developed in class. We'll lump these two together and call it *profile drag*, which is the *combined drag due to viscous effects*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce form drag, we want a 'nice' separation (a laminar one). This has been known since at least 1810 when Sir George Cayley produced his minimum drag shape (which it has been suggested was modelled on a Trout!):\n",

    "These things help reduce form drag by having laminar separation, but in doing so we've *increased* the surface area of the body. Thus, we have increased skin friction drag. It follows that **to minimise profile drag, we have a compromise between skin friction and form drag**. We can see that a flat plate and cylinder of the same cross-sectional area have different total drag due to form drag - see:\n",
