    " and _basic_ static stability characteristics have been explored in the form of derivatives. Whilst further understanding of the static stability derivatives can be performed using the methodologies shown, the full dynamic stability analysis is what is really required for aircraft design.\n",
    " \n",
    "When designing an aircraft for any given use case, the dynamic behaviour must be predicted via modelling of the system[^1]. You may design an aircraft with a drag-saving fuselage, a high-lift supercritical wing section, and a myriad of other 'high-tech' benefits - but if it cannot be flown, then it will be useless (if it is unstable, has poor handling qualities or, in the case of a military aircraft, is *too* stable).\n",

    "\n",
    "Equations {eq}`eq:tranlationalnonlinear` and {eq}`eq:rotationalnonlinear` comprise the **nonlinear aircraft equations of motion**, since they describe the relationships between forces and moments, and the motion in 6DoF. Equations {eq}`eq:attitiudetoanglenonlinear` and {eq}`eq:angletoattitudenonlinear` are required to related aircraft quantities into the inertial reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables are the translational motion, $\\vec{V}=\\left[U, V, W\\right]^T$, and the rotational motion, $\\vec{omega}=\\left[P, Q, R\\right]^T$. These are referred to as **state variables** of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be apparent that {eq}`eq:tranlationalnonlinear` and {eq}`eq:rotationalnonlinear` are nonlinear since:\n",
    "- There are **product terms** in the right hand side _e.g.,_ $P\\,V-Q\\,U$\n",
    "- **Trigonometric terms** _e.g.,_ $D\\cos\\alpha + L\\sin\\alpha$\n",
    "- In the above the aerodynamic angle of attack, $\\alpha$, is a trigonometric function of two state variables, $U$, and $W$\n",
    "- We further know that the non-conservative aerodynamic forces, $L$ and $D$ are nonlinear functions of $\\alpha$ (and $V_\\infty$, $M_\\infty$, _etc._)\n",
    "\n",
    "The full nonlinear equations of motion can only be solved analytically for a small subset of problems, and often they are utilised through numerical solution - which is a _brute force_ means of analysing a system, and cannot easily help us determine stability characteristics. Furthermore, it's an _inelegant_ means to work, and it would be be superb if there were a better means to analyse these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So - the equations of motion shall be linearised to help understand stability."
