    "Linearisation or *small disturbance* theory is the process via which the equations of motion shall be _simplified_ and how the aircraft dynamic behaviour may be analysed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic assumptions are that aircraft motion comprises *small disturbances* from a *trim/equilibrium* state. This is a valid assumption for most flight conditions, but care must be taken when exploring high manoeuvre flight as such analyses require solution of the full nonlinear equations of motion (via numerical solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that at any given time, the instantaneous value of the aircraft state and control variables[^2] may be represented by the trim value (denoted by a subscript $_0$) and this small disturbance (either lowercase, or with $^\\prime$ in some cases, or a $\\Delta$ in other cases):\n",

Some texts use a subscript 'e' for _equilibrium_, but this is ambiguous as it also could be quantities in earth axes.
