    "From the equation we developed in the preceding section for angular momentum, we can easily see that if we have unity angular rate in all three aircraft axes ($P=Q=R=1$), then any non-zero products of inertia (the off-diagonal terms) will result in angular momentum that is not aligned with the angular rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words - application of angular rate about axes for which the products of inertia are non-zero results in a net force, and requires net torque to maintain steady rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this can be difficult to grasp - but is a consequence of the choice of aircraft body axes. Although we defined the aircraft body axes with centre at the centre of gravity, the orientation of the axes was arbitrarily chosen to be nose/wing/down.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general 3D body, it is always possible to find three mutually-orthogonal axes about which the products of inertia are zero. For simple bodies, these are obvious - see FigureÂ {numred}`CylinderAxes` which shows a simple cylinder with two rotation axes, both of which pass through the centre of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be immediately obvious though, that free of any torque the cylinder could rotate indefinitely at a constant rate about one of these axes, but not about the other. Around the axis down the centre axis of the cylinder, the products of inertia would be zero. Around the other axis, they will be non-zero. This concept can be extended to our aircraft.\n",
