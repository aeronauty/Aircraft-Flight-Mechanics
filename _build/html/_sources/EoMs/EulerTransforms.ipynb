    "\n",
    "-   Yaw $(\\psi)$ - The angle between the projection of $x_b$ on the plane of the earth, and the $x$ axis, defined as rotation around $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Pitch $(\\theta)$ - The angle between the aircraft $x_b$ axis, and the earth $x_e/y_e$ plane, defined as rotation around intermediate axis $y_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Roll $(\\phi)$ - The angle between the aircraft $x_b/y_b$ plane, and the intermediate $x_2/y_2$ plane - defined as rotation around $x_2$.\n",

    "A transformation matrix is desired to enable the definition of, for two axes systems with co-located origins, what a set of co-ordinates in one axes system is in the other. That is, at this stage we are not concerned with axial translation and we only wish to look at the effect of angular translation (yaw, pitch, and roll).\n",

    "### Earth axes to intermediate axes $[x_1, y_1, z_1]$ through Yaw, $\\psi$\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform an *Euler transform* to define $x_E,y_E$ in the intermediate axes $x_1,y_1$, noting that $z_e=z_1$. You may have seen Euler transforms before, but they can be confusing, and are not clearly described in many textbooks - and, occasionally, taught incorrectly[^3]. Euler transforms don't just appear in Flight Mechanics - if you do anything with rotation, then they come in handy all the time - so mastering this will put you in excellent stead for rotary aerodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to getting an Euler transform correct is to understand what you're doing - you are trying to describe a point that has *original* co-ordinates $x_e, y_e$ in the earth axis system, and wish wish to determine what co-ordinates it would have in this new axis system $x_1, y_1$. We can use basic trigonometry to work this out. Apply the following rules, and you should be okay:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Draw your unrotated axis set in any arbitrary orientation. Figure {numref}`EulerPsi` (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Use your right hand to orient the axis system (see Figure {numref}`RHRule`), and determine the direction of the positive third axis (in or out of the page). In Figure {numref}`EulerPsi` (a), the $z$-axis is positive *into the page*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The right hand screw rule - See Figure {numref}`RHScrewRule` - defines the direction of positive rotation - for Figure, this is a *clockwise* rotation. Draw your rotated axes set at some arbitrary positive angle of rotation - in this case, through Yaw ($\\psi$) - Figure {numref}`EulerPsi` (b) .\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Recall that you are defining what the point $x_e,y_e$ would be in this new axis set - we can do this for each of them individually. Pick one, say $x_e$, and draw a right-angle triangle with the unrotated axis ($x_e$) as the hypotenuse. The adjacent side defines the component of $x_e$ along $x_1$, whilst the opposite side defines the component of $x_e$ along $y_1$ which we can see is negative in this case - Figure {numref}`EulerPsi` (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Do the same for the remaining unrotated axis - Figure {numref}`EulerPsi` (d).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Collect the components are along the *rotated* X-axis, $x_1$:$x_1=x_e\\cdot\\cos\\psi+y_e\\cdot\\sin\\psi$\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Collect the components are along the *rotated* Y-axis, $y_1$:$y_1=y_e\\cdot\\cos\\psi-x_e\\cdot\\sin\\psi$ noting the *minus* sign in this one, as $x_e\\cdot\\sin\\psi$ was pointed in the *negative* $y_e$ direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  We have already stated that $z_1=z_e$, so we can write the above in matrix form: \n",

    "        \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Check that you have a matrix with; four trig terms, four zeros, and a single unity term (1). The top-left and bottom-right trig term will be a positive cosine. The top-right, and bottom-left trig term will be a sine - one positive, one negative. The (1) will be in a row and column of its own, and everything else will be zero. **If your transformation matrix doesn't follow these rules, you've messed up.**\n",
