    "Measuring translations and velocities for a ground-based vehicle (your car) is relatively simple as the vehicle is moving with respect to an inertially-fixed reference frame (the Earth), that it is *always* connected to. To determine how long it will take to get somewhere, distance/time/velocity calculations are simple, and the engine performance is chiefly a function of the vehicle speed.\n",

    "By comparison, an aircraft is moving with respect to the inertially-fixed reference frame, but it is not connected to it - thus is it difficult to make measurements between the two. Furthermore, aerodynamic performance (how much lift and drag is being produced) is a function of the aircraft's orientation and translation with respect to the incident wind, and not to the Earth. Similarly, the powerplant performance will be a function of the incident wind and not the groundspeed.\n",
